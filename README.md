## (Nearly) Identical Implementations of Tic-Tac-Toe in (Almost) Every Language I Know

Over the last few years, its become tradition for me to build a tic-tac-toe clone in every new language I learn. My learning order usually goes:

1. Language Basics
2. Hello World Program
3. Intermeditate Concepts
3. Tic-Tac-Toe Program
4. Advanced Concepts
5. GUI App/Complex Game (i.e. Asteroids)

This repo hosts many of these tic-tac-toe clones.

If you're interested in learning more about the original tic-tac-toe game, you can find the [original game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) on Wikipedia.

NOTES:
- Programs are Commented With Borderline Unnecessary Detail to Make Them Easier to Look Back on and Reference.
- Many Implementations Clear Your Console Before Running.
- All Implementations are Written to ONLY Work on Linux/WSL*.

<sup><sub>*The Biggest Reason for this is the System "clear" Command that Every Program Shares. Cross-Compatibility is in the Works.</sub></sup>
